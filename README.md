## Introduction

AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) provides a highly scalable and durable object storage solution. One of the powerful features of S3 is the ability to trigger AWS Lambda functions in response to events that occur in your S3 buckets. This allows you to automate various tasks, such as processing uploaded files, generating thumbnails, or sending notifications, in response to S3 events.

This README guide will walk you through the process of setting up AWS S3 Event Triggering using AWS Lambda functions. You'll learn how to configure an S3 bucket to send events to a Lambda function when specific actions, such as object creation or deletion, occur in the bucket.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create Lambda functions, S3 buckets, and IAM roles.
- AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed and configured with your AWS credentials.
- Basic knowledge of AWS services, Lambda functions, and S3 buckets.

## Setting Up AWS S3 Event Triggering

Follow these steps to set up AWS S3 Event Triggering:

### 1. Create an AWS Lambda Function

1. **Create a Lambda Function**: Use the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI to create a new Lambda function. This function will be triggered by S3 events. You can use a pre-existing Lambda function if you have one.

2. **Define the Lambda Function**: Write the code for your Lambda function, specifying how it should respond to S3 events. Ensure that your Lambda function expects the event structure generated by S3 events (usually containing a `Records` key) and processes it accordingly.

### 2. Configure the S3 Bucket

1. **Create an S3 Bucket**: If you haven't already, create an S3 bucket where you want to track events. You can do this through the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.

2. **Bucket Permissions**: Ensure that the S3 bucket and objects have the necessary permissions to invoke the Lambda function. You can set these permissions via the S3 bucket's access control settings.

### 3. Configure the S3 Event Trigger

1. **Bucket Event Configuration**: Configure the S3 bucket to trigger the Lambda function when specific events occur, such as object creation or deletion. You can do this in the AWS Management Console by navigating to the bucket's properties and configuring event notifications.

2. **Lambda Function as the Target**: Specify your Lambda function as the target to invoke when the S3 event occurs. Ensure that you configure the correct event type (e.g., `ObjectCreated`) and prefix/suffix filters if needed.

## Testing the S3 Event Trigger

To test your AWS S3 Event Triggering setup, perform the following steps:

1. Upload a file to the configured S3 bucket that matches the event criteria you specified (e.g., an object creation event).

2. Monitor the Lambda function's execution logs in the AWS CloudWatch Logs to verify that it is triggered and executes as expected.

3. Review any output or notifications generated by your Lambda function to confirm that the desired actions are taking place in response to the S3 event.

## Customization and Advanced Use Cases

You can customize and extend your AWS S3 Event Triggering setup for various advanced use cases, including:

- Processing different types of S3 events (e.g., object deletion, metadata updates).
- Implementing error handling and retries in your Lambda function.
- Integrating with other AWS services like SNS, SQS, or DynamoDB for more complex workflows.
- Setting up cross-account S3 event triggers if you need to trigger Lambda functions in a different AWS account.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your AWS S3 Event Triggering setup, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Review AWS CloudWatch Logs for your Lambda function to check for error messages or unexpected behavior.
- Verify IAM roles and permissions for your Lambda function and S3 bucket.
- Double-check the S3 event configuration to ensure it matches the events you want to trigger.
- Test your Lambda function with sample events to ensure it behaves as expected.

## Conclusion

AWS S3 Event Triggering is a powerful feature that enables you to automate tasks in response to events in your S3 buckets. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can set up and customize event triggers to streamline your AWS workflows and respond to S3 events effectively.

##Note:
don't forget to add your account ID in the lambda py file --> topic_arn = 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:<account-id>:s3-lambda-sns'
